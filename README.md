These are replication files for the paper "Family Norms and Declining
First Marriage Rates: The Role of Sibship Position in the Japanese Marriage Market" by Fumiya Uchikoshi, James M. Raymo, and Shohei Yoda, published in the June issue of Demography in 2023.

This repository has three folders, "00_TidyData_HM", "01_RScript", and "02_Output". The details are described below.

## 00_TidyData_HM
- TidyData_HM.csv -- input data for the harmonic mean models, generated from the microdata of the Japanese National Fertility Surveys (JNFS). It contains the number of first marriages and male/female population at risk by year, age (5-year interval), and sibship status (for both men and women).

## 01_RScript
- 01_ASFMR_CF.R -- R script for calculating availability ratio (AR) and forces of attractions (FoA) for age-pairing-specific first marriages. It also generates counterfactual first marriage hazards/rates holding either AR or FoA at the initial period (i.e., the 1980s).

- 02_Table1_2.R -- a code replicating the figures shown in Table 1 and Table 2.
- 03_Table3.R -- a code replicating the figures shown in Table 3.

## 02_Output
Results generated by the R scripts above are stored in this folder, saved as an rds file.

- APSFMR_CF.rds -- counterfactual age-pairing-specific first marriage rates.
- APSFMR_obs.rds -- observed age-pairing-specific first marriage rates.
- AR_F.rds -- availability ratio for women.
- AR_M.rds -- availability ratio for men.
- FOA.rds -- forces of attraction.
- PairingCont_to_TFMR.rds -- contributions of each pairing to the overall TFMR.
- DF_YearAgeSib_obs.rds -- a tibble containing the number of first marriages and the population at risk for men and women by year, age, and sibship status.
